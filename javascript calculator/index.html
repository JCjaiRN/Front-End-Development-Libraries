      <p>
        Your Assignment: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: <a href="https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/zrRzMR">https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/zrRzMR.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
        </br>
        Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
      <ul>
        <li>User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.</li>
          <li>
            User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.</li>
            <li>
              User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.</li>
      </ul></p>

      <p>My self-chatter:</p>
      <p>We are, weirdly enough, not supposed to look at the model code, so I am looking around the internet instead.</p>
      <p><a href="http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/javascript-css3-calculator">This one</a>, by Kushagra Agarwal on thecodeplayer.com, is pretty cool. Amazing to watch a fluent CSS worker in motion.
      </p>

      Other people offering to teach a calculator exercise:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-intermediate-en-jfhjJ/0/1">Codecademy I</a> (with <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/forums/web-intermediate-en-jfhjJ/0">forum</a>)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-advanced-en-x6JWW/0/1">Codecademy II</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/on-screen-calculator">Odin Project</a></li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>No one seems super worried about error cases: the user inputting several operators or decimal points in a row, dividing by zero, quirks of Javascript binary/decimal conversions (1.0-0.9 != .1), etc. Some are addressed, some not, in various models online. I'm going to put that outside the scope of this beginner exercise for now.</p>
      <p>
      Nor does this "user story" spec actually request a separate "C" and "CE" function, nor a "%", despite their presence in the model.
      <p>
      <p>There also seems to be a general proposal that you should just allow the user to use to buttons to input an expression of any length (2+3-4*5/2 etc etc), and then just 'eval' the expression string when they press the equals key. Okay, that's probably more modern, in terms of actual calculator apps. But as a coding exercise I am going to try for something more old school: just two inputs, plus an operator,at a time. For my coding exercise I'm going to try implementing it without the long input strings.</p><p>
      I might also try avoiding the 'eval' function. Although I guess it's not a security hazard if the user cannot pass it uncontrolled arguments, it still seems a bit like cheating.</p>
<hr>
<p>Anyway. Lots of little features to add and things I would like to clean up, but for now I am going to plough on with my FCCamp overview education... This is was first thing I've really built, and it was a super helpful exercise. And fun.</p>
